    "## Instances of Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java** is an **object-oriented programming language**, focusing on the manipulation of **objects**. **Objects** are a **reference type**, meaning they combine **primitive** and **reference data types**. When referenced, it points to their storage location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of each object is defined by a **class**, which acts as a template. A **class** outlines what an object is and what it can do, similar to a **blueprint** for a house. Each house (object) built from this blueprint (class) may vary in appearance but shares common features and functions."

    "## Initializing Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an **object**, we call the object's **constructor**. Every **class** must have a constructor; if you don't create one, a default empty constructor is provided. If a **class** is like a blueprint, the **constructor** is the architect bringing it to life. The **constructor** takes in parameters (e.g., name, age) and assigns specific values to create the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Car(String brand, String model, int year)\n",
    "Car flash = new Car(\"BMW\", \"X7\", 2023);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an object is similar to creating a variable: start with the **type**, enter the object's **name**, and use the **equals sign** (assignment operator) to assign a value. Use the **new** keyword to create a new object. The order of parameters in the **constructor** matters; an **IllegalArgumentException** will arise if the order is incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** can have multiple **constructors** (overloading), differentiated by their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **null** keyword means no reference is created, and the object contains nothing:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Car lightning = null;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Be cautious with **null** objects, as calling a method on them results in a **NullPointerException**."

    "5. **Body**: `totalHours += hoursStudied;` - The method's action.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be called on an object:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Person bob = new Person(\"bob\");\n",
    "bob.study(2);\n",

    "In this snippet:\n",

However, methods in Java can have various return types, both **primitive** and **reference types**. Methods can return types like **int**, **String**, **boolean**, **double**, **Object**, and more. Implementing a non-void return type allows storing the result for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method with a non-void return type must end with a **return statement**, specifying what the method returns. The return statement must be the last line in the method.\n",

    "```java\n",

    "\n",
    "The **substring** method is overloaded with two versions. In Java, indexing starts at 0, meaning the first character of a string has an index of 0. For example, the string `\"taco cat\"` has a length of 8 characters, with indices from 0 to 7."

    "Answer the following questions based on the code above:\n",
    "* a) What is the purpose of the `Car` class in the given code? How does it represent the concept of objects in Java?\n",
    "* Answer: The Car class serves as a blueprint for creating car objects, encapsulating relevant attributes like brand, model, year, and whether the car is electric. By defining a class, it allows for the creation of multiple instances (objects) of Car, each with distinct property values that represent individual cars. This demonstrates the object-oriented programming principle of encapsulation, allowing data and related behaviors to be grouped together.\n",
    "* b) Explain how the `printCarInfo` method is used in the code. What information does it display, and how is it called?\n",
    "* Answer: The printCarInfo method is designed to output the details of a car object in a formatted string. It displays the car's brand, model, year, and electric status when called. In the code, it is invoked using the car1 object with the line car1.printCarInfo();, which prints the information to the console.\n",
    "* c) The method `isElectricCar` returns a boolean value. Explain how this method is used with the `car2` object and what the output will be.\n",
    "* Answer: The isElectricCar method checks if the car2 object (a Ford Mustang) is electric by returning the value of its isElectric attribute. This method is called in the statement System.out.println(\"Is car2 electric? \" + car2.isElectricCar());. Since car2 was created with isElectric set to false, the output will indicate that car2 is not electric, displaying: \"Is car2 electric? false\".\n",
    "* d) If you wanted to add a new method to the `Car` class to calculate the car's age, how would you implement it? Provide a brief code example. \n",
    "* Answer: To calculate the car's age, you can implement a method called calculateCarAge that takes the current year as an argument and returns the difference between the current year and the car's year. For example, the method could look like this: public int calculateCarAge(int currentYear) { return currentYear - this.year; }. You would use this method in the main program by calling car1.calculateCarAge(2024), which would return the age of car1 based on the provided year."
