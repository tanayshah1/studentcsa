In my role as Scrum Master, I was entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring our team stayed aligned and focused on our project’s goals. It wasn’t just about assigning tasks; I made sure each team member was actively engaged and had something meaningful to work on, fostering an environment where collaboration thrived. I was deeply involved in every step of the process, making sure that the entire team had clear direction while maintaining a sense of autonomy and ownership over their work.

But my contribution didn’t stop there. I was fully invested in the technical side of the project as well. While overseeing the team, I played a critical role in the development of the project, with a significant focus on the frontend. My primary goal was to ensure a seamless, intuitive user experience. I took charge of connecting the backend with the frontend in ways that ensured smooth data flow and real-time interactivity. This was a key challenge that required deep problem-solving and constant iteration, and I thrived in that environment.

The features I’m most proud of are the key pages I developed: the buy, sell, portfolio, and home pages. I didn’t just build these features—I designed them to be robust, user-friendly, and interactive, considering the needs of every user. I integrated real-time stock prices with the portfolio management system, allowing users to easily track their investments. The buy and sell pages were developed with precision, making them functional yet easy to navigate. Meanwhile, the homepage was crafted to provide a seamless introduction to the platform, offering a dynamic and personalized experience.

Seeing these features come to life was incredibly rewarding. I’m extremely proud of what we built as a team, but especially of my contributions in shaping the frontend and ensuring it worked seamlessly with the backend. The project turned out exactly as I envisioned it, and I can confidently say it was one of the most fulfilling and impactful experiences in my development journey. The work reflects not only the technical challenges we overcame but also the dedication and passion I poured into making sure the final product was something everyone could be proud of.
