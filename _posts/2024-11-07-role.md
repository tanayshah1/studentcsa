Throughout the entirety of the project, I took on the responsibility of leading my team, ensuring that each member was not only assigned tasks but also had the opportunity to engage with various aspects of the project. I wanted to make sure that no one was isolated in their work and that every individual had the chance to contribute to different components, fostering a collaborative environment that allowed us to leverage everyone's strengths.

I led our in-person meetings in class with a focus on maintaining clear communication, ensuring that our discussions were efficient, productive, and aligned with the project’s goals. I made it a point to actively encourage participation and idea-sharing, so everyone’s voice was heard and we could make informed decisions as a team. When we weren’t meeting in person, I took charge of virtual calls, where we discussed progress, addressed challenges, and identified action items for the next steps. These calls were crucial in keeping the momentum going, and I made sure that each meeting was structured to move us closer to our objective.

In addition to meetings and calls, I kept the communication channels open through messages, whether for quick updates, clarifications, or just to check in with team members. I understood that staying connected was key to our success, especially in a remote working environment, so I was always proactive in ensuring that the team felt supported and informed.

To maintain transparency and keep everyone aligned, I sent regular updates with pictures and videos, showcasing the progress we made during offline work. These visual updates helped team members stay connected with the project’s development even when they weren’t directly involved in a particular task. By sharing our progress visually, I made sure that everyone understood where we were in the process and could provide feedback or input when necessary.

My approach to leadership wasn’t just about managing tasks; it was about fostering a sense of ownership and collective responsibility. I wanted every team member to feel engaged, motivated, and clear on what needed to be done. By maintaining steady communication and ensuring that everyone was actively involved, I was able to guide the team through the project from start to finish while keeping everyone on track and aligned with our shared vision.
