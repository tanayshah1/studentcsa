At Night at the Museum, I had an incredible opportunity to learn, connect, and grow in ways I hadn't anticipated. The event gave me the platform to present my project to a diverse audience, which included dozens of like-minded peers, aspiring coders, and highly experienced experts in the field. Standing in front of such a knowledgeable crowd was both exciting and humbling, and it allowed me to showcase the work I’ve been so passionate about. The feedback I received was invaluable—it was constructive, insightful, and challenging in the best way possible. Attendees gave me comments that ranged from thoughtful suggestions to technical questions, all of which expanded my understanding of my project and pointed out areas where I could refine and improve my work.

But the experience went beyond just presenting my project. It gave me a chance to immerse myself in a community of driven individuals who are equally passionate about coding and technology. I connected with several students from both CSA and CSSE, and I was able to talk with them about their own projects, aspirations, and unique interests within the world of computer science. Each conversation offered a fresh perspective and allowed me to see the incredible variety in the types of work that my peers are doing. From web development to artificial intelligence, I learned about projects that were both inspiring and eye-opening, which helped me appreciate the vast scope of possibilities within the field.

What really stood out to me was how this event brought together individuals from different backgrounds and areas of focus, all with a shared love for coding. It created a space where I could ask questions, exchange ideas, and even offer some of my own experiences and insights to others. The sense of community was palpable, and it was motivating to know that I’m part of a larger network of people who share my passion and curiosity. I left the event feeling energized and inspired, with new ideas for my own projects and a deeper appreciation for the work that others are doing. It was an unforgettable experience that not only helped me grow as a coder but also reaffirmed my enthusiasm for the endless possibilities in the tech world.

I was able to comment on all of the projects/groups I talked to!
