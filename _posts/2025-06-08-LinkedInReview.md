# 🧠 Blog Highlights

## 📌 Overview of Projects

As **Scrum Master**, I led a team of over 20 students in the end-to-end development of **Gamify**, an educational platform composed of interactive learning games.

One of our core modules was a **real-time stock market simulator**:
- 💻 As a **Full-Stack Developer**, I helped create both backend data pipelines and frontend UI for stock trading using fake currency.
- 🔗 I integrated the **Yahoo Finance API** to fetch real-time stock data, enhancing realism and learning value.
- 🗃️ Designed an **SQLite schema** with one-to-one mapping to user profiles for clean and scalable data structure.
- 🎨 Contributed extensively to the frontend, crafting an aesthetic and user-friendly design that worked seamlessly across devices.

## 📜 Certification of Articulation Success: Data Structures

### ✅ Lesson 1: Greedy Best-First Search & Graph Heuristics
- I learned how heuristic-based strategies like **Greedy Best-First Search** provide rapid solutions for complex graph problems by prioritizing estimated proximity to the goal.
- I explored real-world tradeoffs in algorithm design, understanding how **speed vs. accuracy** plays out in domains like routing and AI pathfinding.

### ✅ Lesson 2: Dijkstra’s and A* Algorithms
- I mastered the **A* algorithm**, appreciating how it smartly balances actual cost and heuristic estimates (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)) to find optimal paths faster than Dijkstra’s alone.
- Through A* and Dijkstra’s, I understood **cost functions and admissible heuristics** as key data structure tools for building intelligent search algorithms in games, navigation, and networks.

## 🧪 Blog: Showcasing Projects — N@TM (Night at the Museum)

We showcased our team projects at **Night at the Museum (N@TM)** in June 2025. This public exhibition allowed us to:
- Present our platform and receive **real-time feedback** from educators, peers, and industry visitors.
- Improve our project through iteration, based on the insightful suggestions and reactions we received during the showcase
- [Link ](url)

The event emphasized the importance of public speaking, user experience, and responding to constructive feedback — all essential developer soft skills.
