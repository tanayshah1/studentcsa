Over the past trimester in CSA, I worked on various projects that challenged my coding skills and collaboration abilities. One of the most significant tasks I tackled was creating a universal theme for the Nighthawk Coders repository. At first, I thought this would be a relatively straightforward process, but I quickly realized it was more complex than I had anticipated.

One of the biggest challenges was coordinating with other groups to ensure consistency across different parts of the project. There were delays and moments of frustration when our progress stalled due to miscommunication or conflicting ideas. Despite these setbacks, I learned valuable lessons about teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving. Debugging issues and refining the theme required patience and persistence, and I gained a deeper understanding of how real-world coding projects involve more than just writing functional code—it’s about integration, collaboration, and refining details to create a cohesive final product.

Beyond this, I am especially proud of the work I did on both the backend and frontend for our stock project. Developing both aspects gave me a well-rounded experience and strengthened my skills in full-stack development. Additionally, taking on the role of a product lead was a rewarding experience, as it pushed me to step up in a leadership capacity and help guide the team toward our goals.

Looking back, even though the process was difficult, I am proud of what we accomplished. The final theme not only looked polished but also helped bring uniformity to the repository, making it easier to navigate and visually appealing. However, I recognize that there are areas I need to improve upon, particularly meeting deadlines and long-term planning. There were moments where last-minute scrambles could have been avoided with better organization and foresight. Moving forward, I plan to take these lessons with me, improving how I communicate with teammates, manage complex projects more efficiently, and structure my workflow to ensure smoother execution of tasks.
