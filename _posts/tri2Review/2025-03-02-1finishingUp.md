For the NITD Stocks project, I focused on developing a comprehensive stock analysis system designed to track, evaluate, and interpret stock market trends. The project required working with financial data, implementing algorithms for stock evaluation, and ensuring that the system provided clear, actionable insights for users.

One of the biggest challenges was handling large sets of stock market data efficiently. I had to find ways to process and filter relevant information while maintaining accuracy and performance. Debugging data inconsistencies and optimizing calculations were key parts of the development process. Additionally, I worked on refining the logic behind stock trend predictions, ensuring the system could provide meaningful insights rather than just raw data.

Beyond the technical aspects, I also focused on making the interface user-friendly, ensuring that the information was presented in a way that was easy to understand and interact with. There were moments of frustration, especially when unexpected bugs slowed progress, but I pushed through by troubleshooting and iterating on the design.

In the end, the project came together successfully, providing a functional and efficient tool for stock analysis. Despite the difficulties along the way, completing the project was rewarding, and Iâ€™m proud of the final product.
