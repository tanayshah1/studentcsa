At the end of Trimester 1, Mr. Mort asked our team a question that exposed a critical flaw in our backend organization. All user, stocks, crypto, and casino data were stored in a single table, leading to confusion, inefficiencies, and errors during data retrieval. When we attempted to migrate the backend, these structural issues caused further complications, impacting not just our team but the entire CSA group.

To resolve this, we analyzed database relationships and implemented one-to-one and many-to-one mappings, properly distributing data into separate tables based on their logical groupings. We became the second team to figure out this structure, which significantly improved data organization, query efficiency, and overall backend performance. This restructuring streamlined our system, reduced redundancies, and made future modifications much more manageable.
