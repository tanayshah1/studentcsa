The one-to-one mapping is a key feature that establishes a direct and exclusive link between each element and its corresponding counterpart. This mapping technique helps maintain clarity, organization, and accuracy, ensuring that no element is duplicated or overlooked. Whether applied in data management, coding, or user interfaces, this feature streamlines processes, minimizes confusion, and allows for more efficient management of complex systems. By enforcing unique associations, the one-to-one mapping enhances the structure and consistency of the project, ultimately improving user experience and system functionality.




# **One-to-One Mapping Explanation: Person & userStocksTable**

## **Overview**
This Java code establishes a **one-to-one relationship** between two database entities:  
- **`Person`**: The **primary entity** (master table) that holds major user details, including their **balance**.
- **`userStocksTable`**: A **secondary entity** that manages **stocks, cryptocurrency, casino activity**, and synchronizes balance updates.

By implementing **JPA annotations (`@OneToOne`)**, this relationship ensures each `Person` object corresponds to exactly **one** `userStocksTable` object.

---

## **Entity: Person**
The `Person` class represents a user and is responsible for:  
✔ Storing **basic user information**.  
✔ Maintaining the **user’s balance**.  
✔ Managing **JSON-based daily statistics**.  
✔ Establishing a **one-to-one mapping** with `userStocksTable`.

### **Key Fields and Annotations**
```java
@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "person")
@JsonIgnore
private userStocksTable user_stocks;
