During the migration into the Nighthawk Coders repository, it became immediately clear that the varying styling choices from different teams led to a fragmented, inconsistent, and sometimes unpolished user interface. This lack of uniformity not only created a visually chaotic experience but also made navigating the repository less intuitive for users. As my group had been recognized for having the best UI design, we were tasked with a critical roleâ€”developing a universal theme that could be implemented across all projects within the repository. Our goal was to create a cohesive, streamlined aesthetic that would maintain visual consistency, enhance usability, and ultimately elevate the user experience. By aligning design elements such as color schemes, typography, and layout structures, we ensured that every team could easily adopt and implement the new theme.

### My Reflection: 
While the task seemed straightforward at first, it turned out to be much more challenging than I had expected. Given the size of the CSA class, it took a while to fully understand the unique components of each team's frontend and how we could integrate them into a single theme. We encountered delays, missed deadlines, and struggled to make enough progress at times. Our work even held up some of the other groups, which was frustrating. Despite these setbacks, the final outcome was something I was proud of. At the end, the universal theme looked really good, and it was satisfying to see how the consistent design improved the overall experience across the projects. It was a tough learning experience, but the end result made it worthwhile.
