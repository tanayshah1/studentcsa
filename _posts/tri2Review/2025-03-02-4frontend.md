- **Issue Identified**:
  - The varying styling choices from different teams led to a fragmented, inconsistent, and unpolished user interface.
  - This lack of uniformity created a visually chaotic experience and made navigation less intuitive.

- **Task Assigned**:
  - As my group had the best UI design, we were tasked with developing a universal theme for the Nighthawk Coders repository.
  - The goal was to create a cohesive aesthetic that ensured visual consistency, enhanced usability, and improved the user experience.
  - Focused on aligning design elements such as color schemes, typography, and layout structures.

- **Challenges Encountered**:
  - The task was more challenging than expected, requiring a deep understanding of each team's unique frontend components.
  - Experienced delays, missed deadlines, and struggled to make enough progress at times.
  - The work held up other groups, which was frustrating.

- **Outcome**:
  - The final universal theme was successful and visually appealing.
  - The consistent design significantly improved the overall experience across all projects.
  - Although it was a tough learning experience, the end result made it worthwhile.
