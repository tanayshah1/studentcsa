Through my demonstrated leadership and strong work ethic, I was selected to be the Gamify product lead, a role that involved overseeing five teams and more than 20 students from different periods. My main responsibility was to guide the creation of a combined and cohesive game that users could play, which required careful planning, coordination, and constant communication. This involved a lot of meetings, planning sessions, and back-and-forth messages to ensure that every team was aligned with the overall vision. 

### My Reflection:
As a leader, I faced challenges in managing different personalities and resolving conflicts, but this experience taught me invaluable lessons in leadership. I discovered my own leadership style, how to manage conflict effectively, and how to collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds and skill sets. Ultimately, this project was not only an opportunity to showcase my leadership abilities but also a growth experience that helped me develop as a leader and a team player.
