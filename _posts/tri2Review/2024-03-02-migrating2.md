For the backend, I collaborated with several others, including Srijan and Mathew, to ensure a seamless migration process. Since multiple Gamify groups depended on our NITD backend, we first worked on integrating their systems with ours to confirm everything functioned correctly. This involved troubleshooting API connections, ensuring database compatibility, and testing for edge cases. Once we confirmed stability, I facilitated the transition of our backend to the master Spring 2025 repository, ensuring minimal downtime and smooth deployment.
 
For the frontend, we followed a structured approach to minimize user disruptions. We first had all teams transition to our repository, allowing us to collectively debug and refine the user experience. This phase included improving UI consistency, resolving responsiveness issues, and optimizing performance for smoother interactions. Once the frontend was tested and verified to function efficiently across all integrated components, we finalized the migration to the Nighthawk Coders repository. Throughout the process, I coordinated efforts between different teams to ensure everyone was aligned, leading to a streamlined and functional final product.For the backend, I worked with several others, including Srijan and Mathew, to ensure a smooth transfer. To increase effectiveness, before moving the backend to the master Spring 2025 repo, we had the other Gamify groups import and connect to our NITD backend. From there, I facilitated the transfer over to Spring 2025.

For the frontend, like the backend, I had everyone move over to our repo to fix any bugs and ensure an efficient user experience. Once we confirmed proper functionality, we migrated to Nighthawk Coders.
