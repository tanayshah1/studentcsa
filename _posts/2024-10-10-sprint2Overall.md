# Memory: The Maze Project

One of my most impactful memories is the maze project we worked on in class. I was proud to receive the highest grade among all team projects, which highlighted the dedication we put into it. This project served as a real-life example of our team teaching approach, showcasing how theory can be applied practically.

We built on Mr. Mort's foundational code, which allowed us to focus on enhancing the maze's functionality. The integration of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) proved invaluable, encouraging critical thinking and efficient code structuring.

Overall, the maze project reinforced my passion for programming and demonstrated the importance of collaboration in solving complex problems. It motivated me to explore the vast possibilities within computer science and tackle future challenges with creativity.


# Relevancy: 

# Personal Finance Project

My team and I recently completed a project that integrates everything we've learned over the past two weeks into a personal finance application. This project is a culmination of concepts from Units 1-9 of AP Computer Science A, showcasing our understanding and practical application of these fundamental principles.

### Unit 1: Introduction to Computer Science
In this unit, we learned the basics of programming and problem-solving techniques. We applied these skills to define the scope of our project and determine the key features we wanted to include, such as budget tracking and expense categorization.

### Unit 2: Program Structure
We utilized a structured programming approach, breaking our application into manageable sections. This helped us design our classes and methods effectively, ensuring each component had a specific purpose and functionality.

### Unit 3: Primitive Data Types
Understanding primitive data types was crucial for storing user input, such as income and expenses. We employed different data types to ensure accurate calculations and data handling throughout the application.

### Unit 4: Using Objects
Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles played a significant role in our project. We created various classes, such as `Budget`, `Expense`, and `Income`, which allowed us to model real-world financial concepts effectively and promote code reusability.

### Unit 5: Using Arrays
We implemented arrays to store lists of expenses and income sources. This helped us efficiently manage and manipulate large datasets, making it easier for users to review their financial activities.

### Unit 6: ArrayList
To enhance flexibility, we utilized ArrayLists for dynamic data management. Users can add or remove expenses and income sources easily, ensuring the application remains user-friendly and adaptable.

### Unit 7: Control Structures
Control structures allowed us to build interactive features into our application. We used conditional statements to guide users through different functionalities, such as generating financial summaries based on their input.

### Unit 8: Recursion
Recursion came into play when calculating complex financial scenarios, such as compound interest. We implemented recursive methods to demonstrate these calculations clearly and effectively.

### Unit 9: Inheritance and Polymorphism
We leveraged inheritance to create specialized classes, such as `FixedExpense` and `VariableExpense`, which inherited from a general `Expense` class. This allowed us to implement polymorphism, making our code more flexible and easier to maintain.

Overall, this personal finance project has not only reinforced our understanding of AP Computer Science A concepts but also provided us with a practical tool to help users manage their finances more effectively. We're excited to share our project and showcase how theoretical knowledge can be applied in real-world scenarios.
