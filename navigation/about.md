This is my CSA website. This is the home page - learn more about me. 

# About me

I am a junior at Del Norte High School. I am a 11th grader at Del Norte High School in San Diego. While other 4-year-olds wanted to be Superman or Spiderman, I wanted to be "All The Mans"!

This thirst for trying and learning new things has led me to tinker with various interests ranging from robotics to hip-hop dance to piano (that last one didn't quite pan out :) ). I have won several State and Regional awards with FIRST Lego League, VexIQ, and FIRST Tech Challenge robotics competitions and has been invited to be a keynote speaker for Altitude Learning and the D39X Educational Summit.

I balance my interests with wanting to help my friends and my school get to the next level. In the years to come, Tanay hopes to be a roboticist or an entrepreneur. In my spare time, I like to play football, golf, and video games! My favorite tag line - Carpe Diem!!  

# Who am I? 

I was born in Orange County, CA, and then moved to San Diego when I was 7 years old. I am an Indian American, my parents were born in Mumbai, India and then immigrated here. I was raised with Indian roots, traditions, and customs; I loved every single about it. I love everything about India and Indian culture. I often say "I'm Indian American, Indian first."

I am a big family guy. I love going back and visiting family in India. It's so much fun to go back and understand more about where I come from and who are those around me. Its also so much fun to get pampered :)

|This is the freeform picture that I created on the top left, there are 3 people showing the three people in my family. Under that, there is the Indian flag merged with the American flag showing my mixed cultural heritage. Then I have a football and golf since I enjoy playing those sports.|
